## Configuration

NekoEssentials offers various configuration options to tailor the mod to your server's needs. You can find and modify the configuration file in the `config/nekoessentials.json` (or a similarly named file, typically generated on the first run) in your Minecraft server directory.

While the source code mentions `NekoConfig.kt`, the actual configuration will be generated in a common format like JSON or TOML in your server's `config` folder.
